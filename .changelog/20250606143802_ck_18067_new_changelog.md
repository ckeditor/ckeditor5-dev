The `checkVersionAvailability()` and `findPathsToPackages()` functions exported by the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools` package have been moved to the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils` package. 

For backward compatibility, they are still available in the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools` package and will be removed in the next major release.
