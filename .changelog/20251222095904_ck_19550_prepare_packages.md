Resolve a race condition in the release preparation process where nested files defined in the `#files` glob pattern could trigger the `EEXIST` error.

Copying files is now performed sequentially using a `for...of` loop instead of `Array#map()`, ensuring that directories are created deterministically before each copy operation.

This change improves the stability of `prepareRepository()` when handling deeply nested or overlapping glob patterns.
