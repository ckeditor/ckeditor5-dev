Removed git-based changelog utils after switching to a Markdown-based solution.

The following utils have been removed:

* `generateChangelogForSinglePackage()`,
* `generateChangelogForMonoRepository()`,
* `saveChangelog()`.

Markdown-based changelog utils are available in the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-changelog` package.
