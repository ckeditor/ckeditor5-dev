Added a top-level `linkFilter()` callback option for changelog generators that determines which issue links should be preserved in the generated changelog and which should be removed. If the `shouldSkipLinks` flag is also provided, the `shouldSkipLinks` flag takes precedence over the `linkFilter()` callback to maintain backward compatibility.
