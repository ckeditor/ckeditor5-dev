Treat updated English translations in the `t()` calls as new messages to translate in other languages.

In the past, the translation tooling assumed that English translation passed to the `t( { id: '...', string: '...' } )` function in the `string` key would not be changed. In reality, this assumption is not true and leads to outdated translations in all `*.po` files. Now, when synchronizing the translations, the tooling detects updated English translations in the source code and treats them as new messages to translate.
