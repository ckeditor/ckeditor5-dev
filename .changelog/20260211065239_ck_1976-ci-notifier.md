Made `ckeditor5-dev-ci-circle-workflow-notifier` resilient to unstable CircleCI API responses by adding retries, response shape validation, and clearer hard-fail reasons.

The notifier now retries transient API failures up to 5 times with delays, fails fast for non-retryable API errors, and reports when manual workflow verification is required.
