Added two new utils: `getVersionForTag()` and `isLatestOrNextStableVersion()`.

* The `getVersionForTag()` util returns the latest version of a package published under the given [npm tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-dist-tag).
* The `isLatestOrNextStableVersion()` util returns `true` if the provided version is a stable release (i.e., not a pre-release) and is not older than the version currently published under the `latest` [npm tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-dist-tag).
