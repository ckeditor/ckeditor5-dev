The `@latest` versions of `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-*` packages (e.g., [@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils)) now point to the most recent stable packages published under the `latest` npm [dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-dist-tag), ensuring they no longer depend on outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities.
