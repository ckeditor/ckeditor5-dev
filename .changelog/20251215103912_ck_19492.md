The `@latest` versions of `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-*` packages (e.g., [@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils)) previously pointed to builds depending on outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities.

All `ckeditor5-dev-*` packages have been retagged so that the most recent stable versions are now published under the `latest` npm [dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-dist-tag), ensuring users automatically receive secure, up-to-date dependencies via package managers.
