<!--

This repository uses Markdown files to define changelog entries.  
If the changes proposed in this pull request are **user-facing**, consider creating a new entry.

You can do this by running:

    yarn nice

This command will create a `*.md` file in the `.changelog/` directory, allowing you to describe your changes.

**Reminder:**
If your pull request is internal-only (e.g., tests, tooling, docs), you may skip this step - just make a note below.
