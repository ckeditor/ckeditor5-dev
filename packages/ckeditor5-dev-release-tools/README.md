### Generating changelog

This tool can generate a changelog file based on commits in the repository. It can also propose what should be the next release version (according to [SemVer](http://semver.org)).

Read more about the [git commit message convention](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-design/wiki/Git-commit-message-convention) implemented by this tool.

### Creating a release for multiple repositories

**Note:** Before running the bumping versions task you need to generate the changelog for changes in the version to be released.

The process implemented by the tool:

1. Read a new release version from the changelog (the last header),
1. Filter out packages which won't be released (no changes or dependencies has not changed),
1. Update new versions of packages in `package.json` for all released packages,
1. Commit these changes as `Release: vX.Y.Z.`,
1. Create a tag `vX.Y.Z`.

### Publishing changes

**Note:** Before publishing changes you need to bump versions in all dependencies.

The process implemented by the tool:

1. Compares versions released on NPM and GitHub. Based on that, the tool know what should be published. You can call the same script multiple times and nothing wrong happens.
1. If choose publish on NPM: the tool publish changes on NPM.
1. If choose publish on GitHub: the tool creates a [GitHub release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/). Notes for the release are taken from the changelog.
1. If nothing was selected: the tool does nothing. No publish, no push, no creating releases.
