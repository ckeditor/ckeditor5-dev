Utils for [CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com) CI builds.

Contains tools for sending Slack notifications by Travis or Circle CI.

## Available scripts

These commands accept a mix of environment variables and command line arguments. Environment variables are preferred when the value comes from the CI environment or is sensitive (like tokens). Command line arguments are preferred when the value is static or local to a given repository.

> [!WARNING]
> Tokens are passed as environment variables to avoid exposing sensitive credentials in shell history, CI logs, or shared configuration files.

- ⚙️ **`ckeditor5-dev-ci-circle-disable-auto-cancel-builds`**

  **Parameters:**
  - `--organization` &mdash; GitHub organization name.
  - `--repository` &mdash; GitHub repository name.

- ⚙️ **`ckeditor5-dev-ci-circle-enable-auto-cancel-builds`**

- ⚙️ **`ckeditor5-dev-ci-is-workflow-restarted`**
