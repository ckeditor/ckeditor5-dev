### Bug fixes

* **[translations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-translations)**: Added support for providing `options.cwd` parameter to `synchronizeTranslations()` and `moveTranslations()` functions. This `options.cwd` (or `process.cwd()` if not set) is used to resolve paths to packages. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/37c389ce204b1bd571d085ade3809819b2a12307))

## [45.0.6](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v45.0.5...v45.0.6) (2024-10-28)

> [!NOTE]
> The release channel for this release is `next`.

### Bug fixes

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: The `publishPackages()` task should not throw an error after trying to publish packages after reaching an attempted limit. Instead, it should verify if the last try was successfully completed and throw the error if it wasn't. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#17333](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/17333). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/937c093d9993c4a43efb9de673b2fb492c152bd0))

### Other changes

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Increased the attempts limit from 3 to 5. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/937c093d9993c4a43efb9de673b2fb492c152bd0))
* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Created a decorated version of utils (`manifest()`, `packument()`) exposed by the `pacote` package. It prevents from using any cache when checking the npm registry. Direct calls have been replaced with the decorated version. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/937c093d9993c4a43efb9de673b2fb492c152bd0))
