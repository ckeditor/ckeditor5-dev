## [46.0.2](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v46.0.1...v46.0.2) (2025-02-10)

### Other changes

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Exported the `getDateIdentifier()` util that converts the current date into `YYYYMMDD` format. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/c3496f06a68290f8719e2feb03d0401686216aa6))
* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Improved the `getLastPreRelease()` util to distinguish pre-release versions starting with the same base name. Previously, `getLastPreRelease( '0.0.0-nightly' )` matched both `0.0.0-nightly` and `0.0.0-nightly-next` versions, but now only the first one is matched. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/c3496f06a68290f8719e2feb03d0401686216aa6))
