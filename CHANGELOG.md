## [24.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v24.1.0...v24.2.0) (2021-02-16)

### Features

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `bumpVersions()` function can read the changelog file from an external directory (using `options.changelogDirectory`). Thanks to that, the private packages from the mono-repository can be released using a public changelog. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/faa1d1e7aafa5f870e038e94b56a8e03fff48e4f))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `bumpVersions()` function allows skipping upgrading versions of dependencies between updated packages (using `options.skipUpdatingDependencies` which is `false` by default). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/faa1d1e7aafa5f870e038e94b56a8e03fff48e4f))

### Bug fixes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Simplified a check whether a package was published on NPM in the `releaseSubRepositories()` function. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/faa1d1e7aafa5f870e038e94b56a8e03fff48e4f))
* **[utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils)**: A DLL-consumer package produced by webpack should be assigned to the `window` object. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#9039](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9039). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/72c063a3854b6336fcc8528c94887d04b9afa1cf))

### Other changes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `bumpVersions()` function returns a promise with a collection that contains all updated packages. Previously the promise didn't resolve anything. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/faa1d1e7aafa5f870e038e94b56a8e03fff48e4f))

## [24.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v23.6.1...v24.0.0) (2021-01-11)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Renamed `options.packageJsonForEmptyReleases` to `options.packageJsonForCustomReleases` in the `releaseSubRepositories()` function.
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Renamed `options.emptyReleases` to `options.customReleases` in the `releaseSubRepositories()` function.

### Features

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The idea of having "emptyReleases" has been changed to "customReleases" that allows specifying which files from the original package should be copied. Introduced the `customReleasesFiles` option for the `releaseSubRepositories()` function. It allows specifying glob patterns of files that should be copied to the temporary directory from which the package will be published on npm. Closes [[ckeditor/ckeditor5#8616](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8616)](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8616). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/763e69d95048f006c6048c0014e574bc23246a8b))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Added the "--include-external-directory" to the translations:collect task that allows checking packages located in the "external/" directory. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7901](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7901). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/2ab50ca526a7d7f45d5fef0167a8d27728b04233))

## [23.4.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v23.3.0...v23.4.0) (2020-09-02)

### Features

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Introduced the `--repositories` (also known as `-r`) option that allows specifying a name of a repository (or repositories, separated by a comma, similar to the `--files` option) where the tool should look for packages that should be tested. Thanks to that, you do not have to specify all packages of a repository that was cloned into the `external/` directory. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7889](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7889). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/1e8edca9f77b8435d5a2b210c5fa9d7a7ab8c11c))

## [23.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v23.1.1...v23.2.0) (2020-08-20)

### Features

* **[jsdoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-jsdoc-plugins)**: Introduced a plugin that hides the package documentation if in the package's `package.json` file the `private` key is set to `true`. However, by adding the `@publicApi` annotation, you can mark blocks of the code that should not be hidden. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/374efa83b258e40b36a6451a288e494582f8c5ac))
* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Manual test server accepts a new flag: `--identity-file` (alias: `-i`) that allows defining global constants in manual tests. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/374efa83b258e40b36a6451a288e494582f8c5ac))

### Other changes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Improved output displayed while the `translations.upload()` function is working. Instead of displaying `console.log()` after each package, summary tables will be displayed when the function finishes its job. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/fb88a3ed7450c148debbd4bdc5e2a1fbbd82b1f8))
* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Manual test script will not search for tests in the `./manual/_utils` directory. If any of a manual test requires additional utils to work, those can be placed in the `_utils` directory. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/374efa83b258e40b36a6451a288e494582f8c5ac))

## [23.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v22.0.0...v23.0.0) (2020-07-21)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[jsdoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-jsdoc-plugins)**: Functions documented in a module will no longer be documented as static functions. Therefore links to functions will not contain the `static-` part and links created in the past will no longer work.

### Features

* **[jsdoc-plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-jsdoc-plugins)**: Updated JSDoc and align custom JSDoc plugins. Part of [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7575](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7575). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/755e29cde71f67332554cb4bc0c23982651bb524))

  * Improved performance,
  * Fixed incorrectly and inconsistently documented functions. Previously they were marked as static/instance using the `.` or `#` symbols. Now they are documented the same as classes, interfaces, and mixins using the `~` symbol. (e.g. `module:widget/utils~toWidget`),
  * Validator was improved, now it detects duplicated modules and previously hidden mistakes.
  * Updated JSDoc allows for modern JS syntax, `async/await` among others.

## [22.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v21.0.0...v22.0.0) (2020-07-20)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Task `generateChangelogForMonoRepository()` will generate the changelog uses the same version for all packages.

### Features

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Added `sinon-chai` to automated tests. Closes https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7456. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e82040e6a17e87bae6b450df29e5ac7084b5e5be))

### Bug fixes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `getCommit()` util will return a proper array with commits if the release branch in the project is other than `master`. Due to `--first-parent` flag which is used for collecting the commits, when the release branch is other than `master`, commits made on `master` could not be collected directly from the branch. Now those commits are collected in two ranges: from the last tag to the [base commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge-base) and from the base commit to HEAD and merged together. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7492](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7492). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e18db62d33c11dbe2a98a845e46cbde73186fa9d))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Scoped breaking changes notes won't be duplicated in the changelog. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7495](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7495). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e4eefa669bce9a8d1ccca6ce1c92914a17151825))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Commit and note groups should be sorted properly. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7496](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7496). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/a08020cbb29bf62cabc28a71926278abe32f54bf))

### Other changes

* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The `generateChangelogForMonoRepository()` task supports `options.releaseBranch` that is passed directly to the `getCommit()` util. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7492](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7492). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e18db62d33c11dbe2a98a845e46cbde73186fa9d))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: The changelog generator for mono repository will use the same version for all packages. On the screen, a user will see all changes: `MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES`, `MINOR BREAKING CHANGES`, and all commits since the last release. The user must review it and provide the version. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7323](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7323). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/4036b6e359238db764be695f7491e7e3e85901bd))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Merge commits between `stable/release/master` branches will be ignored when generating the changelog, to reduce the noise. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#7489](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7489). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/cedc53f350aef74621f80f8a2e953d18892f5c52))

Closes [#606](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/issues/606). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/6a4dfb24ffb472027ef93144cea0d73e0744c587))
* **[env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-env)**: Commits in the changelog will display the word `commit` instead of the first 7 characters from the commit's hash.

* **[tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests)**: Removed unnecessary scripts after merging the main repository to the monorepo. Closes [#628](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/issues/628). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/e2048e95181c971c221171e33cde86fe990a97af))
* Removed `lerna` and all its files from the project. Now the release process is handled by our tools. The entire repository will follow the same rules as `ckeditor5.` Read more in the [Versioning policy guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html).
