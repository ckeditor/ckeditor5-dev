## [39.4.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v39.3.0...v39.4.0) (2023-12-14)

### Features

* **[stale-bot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-stale-bot)**: Introduced a "stale" bot, which can be executed using the `yarn run ckeditor5-dev-stale-bot [<args>...]` command. It searches for issues and pull requests that are not active enough and then mark them as stale. Stale issues and pull requests are closed after a defined period of time or, if they become active again, they are unstaled by the bot. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#15399](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15399). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/f2afff238f43a699048fbca15d432260652e963f))

### Other changes

* **[utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils)**: Added support in the `Logger#error()` method to print in console an error instance, if provided as the second argument. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/f2afff238f43a699048fbca15d432260652e963f))

## [39.3.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v39.2.1...v39.3.0) (2023-12-06)

### Features

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Allow defining the date format while preparing the changelog file. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#15429](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15429). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/c556c7035c9a88204c908458da8260908ec75d2f))
* **[translations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-translations)**: Compilation asset callback is now an optional field called `assetNamesFilter` in the object passed to the `CKEditorTranslationsPlugin` class. Thanks to that, it improves webpack compilation performance by filtering unrelated assets to reduce `TranslationService.getAssets()` calls. It only affects apps with many webpack entries and/or chunks. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/4b4a22b4a3a1a4b518404773f228b492c660645c))
