## [53.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v53.0.0...v53.1.0) (September 11, 2025)

### Features

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Added two new utils: `getVersionForTag()` and `isLatestOrNextStableVersion()`.

  * The `isLatestOrNextStableVersion()` util returns `true` if the provided version is a stable release (i.e., not a pre-release) and is not older than the version currently published under the `latest` [npm tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-dist-tag).

## [52.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v51.1.0...v52.0.0) (September 8, 2025)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Removed git-based changelog utils after switching to a Markdown-based solution. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#18907](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/18907).

  The following utils have been removed:

  * `generateChangelogForSinglePackage()`,
  * `generateChangelogForMonoRepository()`,
  * `saveChangelog()`.

  Markdown-based changelog utils are available in the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-changelog` package.

### Features

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Added an optional `cwd` option for `validateRepositoryToRelease()`. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#19059](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/19059).
* **[web-crawler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-web-crawler)**: Add `kapa.ai` to the list of ignored hosts. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#19064](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/19064).

### Bug fixes

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Fixed `validateRepositoryToRelease()` not throwing error when the current branch only partially matches the defined required branch. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#19059](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/19059).

  Before the fix, branches with a suffix, eg. `master_foo` would not throw when defined required branch was `master`.
