## [54.3.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v54.2.3...v54.3.0) (January 13, 2026)

### Features

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: The `prepareRepository()` task now applies `publishConfig` overrides directly to copied `package.json` files. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#19608](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/19608).

  Fields defined in `publishConfig` replace their top-level counterparts in the final manifest, and the `publishConfig` field itself is removed from the published file.

### Other changes

* **[changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-changelog)**: Automatically normalize the `see` and `closes` fields from changelog entry into arrays when they are literal values. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#19470](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/19470).
* **[translations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-translations)**: Treat updated English translations in the `t()` calls as new messages to translate in other languages.

  In the past, the translation tooling assumed that English translation passed to the `t( { id: '...', string: '...' } )` function in the `string` key would not be changed. In reality, this assumption is not true and leads to outdated translations in all `*.po` files. Now, when synchronizing the translations, the tooling detects updated English translations in the source code and treats them as new messages to translate.

## [54.2.3](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/v54.2.2...v54.2.3) (December 22, 2025)

### Bug fixes

* **[release-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-release-tools)**: Resolve a race condition in the release preparation process where nested files defined in the `#files` glob pattern could trigger the `EEXIST` error. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#19550](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/19550).

  Copying files is now performed sequentially using a `for...of` loop instead of `Array#map()`, ensuring that directories are created deterministically before each copy operation.

  This change improves the stability of `prepareRepository()` when handling deeply nested or overlapping glob patterns.
